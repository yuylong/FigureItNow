# FigureItNow
FigureItNow is a free application that plots mathematical figures using well-defined script language.

This project tries to find a free solution to build up a general mathematical figuring platform, including a kind of 
script language and a compiler to translate the script codes into figures. FigureItNow (FIN) Script Language is well 
designed to describe mathematical figures. It introduce many characters from C language such as variable, self-
defined functions, mathematical expressions, and . In addition, FIN Script Language implements a lot of predefined 
functions that performs complex data manipulations ranging from mathematical calculation, string computation, to 
figure plotting and image processing. With FIN script codes, you can easily describe a complex figure into a piece 
of neatly written code.

FigureItNow supports many output formats such as PDF, SVG, PNG and so on. Additionally, it also tries to provide a 
re-implementation interface for more potental formats. Therefore you can exports your figure and paste them into your 
work to improve the representability.

FigureItNow is my personal software project originated a small program I wrote in 2002, when I was a young teenage in 
high school. For my personal reason, this project stalled for several years, and finally I decided to resume it in 
2015. Although I still have not much personal time on FigureItNow project, I will try my best to push it forward.
